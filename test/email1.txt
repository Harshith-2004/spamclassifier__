Dear John,

You are cordially invited to attend our Annual Charity Gala on May 20th at Grand Hotel Ballroom. This year's event promises to be an elegant evening filled with live music, gourmet dining, and inspiring speeches.

Your presence would mean a lot to us as we strive to raise funds for Children's Education Fund. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of those in need.

Please RSVP by May 10th to confirm your attendance.
